# Personal Background

In this repo I keep a svg template that gets modified periodically providing a dynamical desktop background.


The idea is to build a svg template linking the images that want to be updated.
Then, the script "main.py" will update the images and export the svg to png (using inkscape). The execution of this script can be added to cron for automatic execution.

The resolution, aspect-ratio... are still to be dealt with. For now, I just prepare a template for each resolution of the computers that I use.
